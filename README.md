### README Description

#### Description

This Java program converts a given number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. After prompting the user to input seconds, it calculates and displays the converted time with explicit labels for each component (`hour:`, `minutes:`, `seconds:`). The program then asks the user if they want to convert another set of seconds or quit. This interactive process continues until the user chooses to exit.

#### Instructions

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. To run the program:
   ```bash
   java TimeConverter
   ```

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the number of seconds you want to convert.
   - After each conversion, decide whether to continue by entering `yes` or `no`.

### Notes

- This program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and control flow in Java.
- Ensure proper input format to avoid unexpected behavior.
